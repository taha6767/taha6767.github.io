Since there were a lot of different genres I had to limit the genres down to the most popular ones and I used the following code to count the number of them

## Bar Chart

## Turkish Content Analysis

- Turkish Content Type: Movies dominate over TV shows in Netflix's Turkish content, probably because movies are easier to produce then whole shows
- 2018 Decline: A notable decrease in Turkish content occurred during this year
- Regulation Impact: New streaming service laws in 2018 required licenses and local broadcasting compliance, potentially limiting content availability
- Strategic Changes: Netflix may have shifted focus to other regions or content types based on global viewing trends
