## Analysis {auto-animate="true"}

\* Turkish Content Type: Movies dominate over TV shows in Netflix's Turkish content, probably because movies are easier to produce then whole shows.

\* 2018 Decline: A notable decrease in Turkish content occurred during this year

\* Regulation Impact: New streaming service laws in 2018 required licenses and local broadcasting compliance, potentially limiting content availability

\* Strategic Changes: Netflix may have shifted focus to other regions or content types based on global viewing trends
