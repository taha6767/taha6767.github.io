The graph illustrates the distribution of genres within Netflix's library, highlighting a significant dominance of the drama genre, which accounts for over 36% of titles. This prevalence is understandable, as dramas often provide the foundation for captivating stories and frequently overlap with other genres, such as science fiction, romance, or thrillers. The substantial share of dramas suggests that Netflix prioritizes these versatile and emotionally engaging stories to attract a wide audience.

In addition to dramas, the Crime/Thriller and Action & Adventure genres also hold notable shares, each comprising around 12% of the content. These genres likely appeal to viewers seeking suspense and high-stakes plots, drawing consistent interest across various demographics. Furthermore, Romantic Comedies represent 11.1% of the library, catering to audiences looking for light-hearted, feel-good content.

Horror genre hovers around only 5%. This is not surprising to me, as an horror fan I always have an hard time finding a good horror show on Netflix due to comparetavily limited options.

According to the graph the cast information was missing for 718 titles on Netflix which indicated the data we have is not of the highest quality.
Anupam Kher is the most frequently cast actor on Netflix with 42 apperances.

Most titles from my home country Turkey have been movies which makes sense as TV Shows are much harder to produce.
There is a substantial decrease in the movies and TV Shows coming from Turkey in 2018 this might be caused by:

Regulatory and Political Issues: In 2018, Turkey introduced new regulations requiring streaming services to obtain licenses and comply with local broadcasting standards. This led to increased scrutiny and potential censorship, which might have affected the availability of Turkish content on platforms like Netflix1.

Content Strategy Shifts: Netflix often adjusts its content strategy based on viewer preferences and market trends. Around that time, Netflix might have shifted its focus to other regions or types of content that were gaining more popularity globally2.

Production Challenges: Political and economic instability in Turkey during that period could have impacted the production and export of TV shows and movies. This might have led to fewer Turkish productions being available for international distribution2.

Despite these challenges, Turkish content has seen a resurgence in recent years, with Netflix investing in new Turkish originals and licensing popular Turkish dramas3.
