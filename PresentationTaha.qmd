## Introduction

-   **Project Goal:** Analyze Netflix's catalog to understand genre distributions, top actors, and content trends related to my home country, Turkey.

-   **Data Source:** TidyTuesday (April 2021 Netflix dataset).

## Genre Distribution

```         
{r,
```

Copy code

`genre_plot`

-   **Observation:** Drama dominates with over 36% of titles.

-   Dramas often overlap with multiple themes, which could explain their prevalence.

-   Crime/Thriller and Action & Adventure each hold around 12%, followed closely by Romantic Comedies at \~11%.

## Other Genre Highlights

-   Comedy and Horror each represent roughly 5%.

-   Science Fiction & Fantasy titles are fewer (\~4%).

-   This distribution suggests Netflix’s focus on emotionally engaging and narrative-rich content (e.g., Drama) and consistently popular genres like Crime/Thriller.

## Top Actors

```         
{r,
```

Copy code

`actor_plot`

-   Data on cast was missing for many titles (over 700).

-   **Top Actor:** Anupam Kher with 42 appearances.

-   Frequent appearances by certain actors may reflect Netflix’s licensing deals or popularity of certain film industries (e.g., Bollywood).

## Turkish Content Distribution

```         
{r,
```

Copy code

`turkish_type_plot`

-   Turkish content consists mainly of movies.

-   TV shows are much rarer, likely due to higher production costs and complexities.

## Turkish Content Over Time

```         
{r,
```

Copy code

`turkish_trend_plot`

-   A notable drop in Turkish titles around 2018.

-   Possible factors:

    -   Regulatory changes and censorship in Turkey.

    -   Netflix content strategy shifts.

    -   Political and economic challenges affecting production.

## Conclusion

-   **Key Insight:** Drama is the backbone of Netflix’s content library.

-   **Actor Spotlight:** Certain actors appear prominently due to regional film industries and licensing deals.

-   **Turkish Content:** Primarily movies, with a dip in production around 2018 due to regulatory and strategic reasons, but recent years have seen renewed interest.

-   This analysis highlights how global streaming services balance multiple genres, star power, and regional content strategies to cater to diverse audiences.
