					<section>
						<img src="TurkishContentGraph.png" style="height: 300px;">
							<p>* Turkish Content Type: Movies dominate over TV shows in Netflix's Turkish content, probably because movies are easier to produce then whole shows. <br>

* 2018 Decline: A notable decrease in Turkish content occurred during this year <br>

* Regulation Impact: New streaming service laws in 2018 required licenses and local broadcasting compliance, potentially limiting content availability <br>

* Strategic Changes: Netflix may have shifted focus to other regions or content types based on global viewing trends
