This prevalence is understandable, as dramas often provide the foundation for captivating stories and frequently overlap with other genres, such as science fiction, romance, or thrillers. The substantial share of dramas suggests that Netflix prioritizes these versatile and emotionally engaging stories to attract a wide audience.\nIn addition to dramas, the Crime/Thriller and Action & Adventure genres also hold notable shares, each comprising around 12% of the content. These genres likely appeal to viewers seeking suspense and high-stakes plots, drawing consistent interest across various demographics. Furthermore, Romantic Comedies represent 11.1% of the library, catering to audiences looking for light-hearted, feel-good content.\nHorror genre hovers around only 5%. This is not surprising to me, as an horror fan I always have an hard time finding a good horror show on Netflix due to comparetavily limited options.\n\n# Extract and count actors\nactor_counts &lt;- netflix %&gt;%\n  mutate(actors = str_extract_all(cast, \"\\\\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\\\\b\")) %&gt;%\n  unnest(actors) %&gt;%\n  count(actors, name = \"n\", sort = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Corrected the count function\n  slice_max(n, n = 10)  # Changed slice_top_n to slice_max\n\n# Plot top 10 actors\nggplot(actor_counts, aes(x = reorder(actors, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"hotpink\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Frequently Cast Actors on Netflix\",\n       x = \"Actor\",\n       y = \"Number of Appearances\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = -0.2, size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph the cast information was missing for 718 titles on Netflix which indicated the data we have is not of the highest quality. Anupam Kher is the most frequently cast actor on Netflix with 42 apperances.\n\n# Extract shows from Turkey\nturkish_shows &lt;- netflix %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(country, \"Turkey\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = as.integer(str_extract(date_added, \"\\\\d{4}\")),\n    type = type  \n  )\n\n# Analyze types of Turkish shows\nturkish_types &lt;- turkish_shows %&gt;%\n  count(type, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Plot distribution of Turkish show types\nggplot(turkish_types, aes(x = \"\", y = n, fill = type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Turkish Content on Netflix\",\n       fill = \"Type\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(type, \"\\n(\", n, \")\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), \n            size = 4)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analyze trends in Turkish content over time\nturkish_trends &lt;- turkish_shows %&gt;%\n  count(year, type) %&gt;%\n  complete(year, type, fill = list(n = 0))\n\n# Plot trends in Turkish content\nggplot(turkish_trends, aes(x = year, y = n, color = type)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Trends in Turkish Content on Netflix\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Titles\",\n       color = \"Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost titles from my home country Turkey have been movies which makes sense as TV Shows are much harder to produce. There is a substantial decrease in the movies and TV Shows coming from Turkey in 2018 this might be caused by:\nRegulatory and Political Issues: In 2018, Turkey introduced new regulations requiring streaming services to obtain licenses and comply with local broadcasting standards. This led to increased scrutiny and potential censorship, which might have affected the availability of Turkish content on platforms like Netflix1.\nContent Strategy Shifts: Netflix often adjusts its content strategy based on viewer preferences and market trends. Around that time, Netflix might have shifted its focus to other regions or types of content that were gaining more popularity globally2.\nProduction Challenges: Political and economic instability in Turkey during that period could have impacted the production and export of TV shows and movies. This might have led to fewer Turkish productions being available for international distribution2.\nDespite these challenges, Turkish content has seen a resurgence in recent years, with Netflix investing in new Turkish originals and licensing popular Turkish dramas3.\nReference: The data comes from the following TidyTuesday Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-04-20"

You can also adjust how many simulations you would like to run and in the end you get summary statistics and a bar graph.\nThrough random sampling with specific variables set at 12 close friends, 4 classes with 20 students each, and a total student population of 1500, the current set mimics my chances of getting a friend in the classes I will be taking next semester. 100,000 simulations are run to determine how likely it is for me to have close friends in different numbers of classes.

This prevalence is understandable, as dramas often provide the foundation for captivating stories and frequently overlap with other genres, such as science fiction, romance, or thrillers. The substantial share of dramas suggests that Netflix prioritizes these versatile and emotionally engaging stories to attract a wide audience.\nIn addition to dramas, the Crime/Thriller and Action & Adventure genres also hold notable shares, each comprising around 12% of the content. These genres likely appeal to viewers seeking suspense and high-stakes plots, drawing consistent interest across various demographics. Furthermore, Romantic Comedies represent 11.1% of the library, catering to audiences looking for light-hearted, feel-good content.\nHorror genre hovers around only 5%. This is not surprising to me, as an horror fan I always have an hard time finding a good horror show on Netflix due to comparetavily limited options.\n\n# Extract and count actors\nactor_counts &lt;- netflix %&gt;%\n  mutate(actors = str_extract_all(cast, \"\\\\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\\\\b\")) %&gt;%\n  unnest(actors) %&gt;%\n  count(actors, name = \"n\", sort = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Corrected the count function\n  slice_max(n, n = 10)  # Changed slice_top_n to slice_max\n\n# Plot top 10 actors\nggplot(actor_counts, aes(x = reorder(actors, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"hotpink\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Frequently Cast Actors on Netflix\",\n       x = \"Actor\",\n       y = \"Number of Appearances\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = -0.2, size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph the cast information was missing for 718 titles on Netflix which indicated the data we have is not of the highest quality. Anupam Kher is the most frequently cast actor on Netflix with 42 apperances.\n\n# Extract shows from Turkey\nturkish_shows &lt;- netflix %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(country, \"Turkey\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = as.integer(str_extract(date_added, \"\\\\d{4}\")),\n    type = type  \n  )\n\n# Analyze types of Turkish shows\nturkish_types &lt;- turkish_shows %&gt;%\n  count(type, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Plot distribution of Turkish show types\nggplot(turkish_types, aes(x = \"\", y = n, fill = type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Turkish Content on Netflix\",\n       fill = \"Type\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(type, \"\\n(\", n, \")\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), \n            size = 4)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analyze trends in Turkish content over time\nturkish_trends &lt;- turkish_shows %&gt;%\n  count(year, type) %&gt;%\n  complete(year, type, fill = list(n = 0))\n\n# Plot trends in Turkish content\nggplot(turkish_trends, aes(x = year, y = n, color = type)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Trends in Turkish Content on Netflix\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Titles\",\n       color = \"Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost titles from my home country Turkey have been movies which makes sense as TV Shows are much harder to produce. There is a substantial decrease in the movies and TV Shows coming from Turkey in 2018 this might be caused by:\nRegulatory and Political Issues: In 2018, Turkey introduced new regulations requiring streaming services to obtain licenses and comply with local broadcasting standards. This led to increased scrutiny and potential censorship, which might have affected the availability of Turkish content on platforms like Netflix1.\nContent Strategy Shifts: Netflix often adjusts its content strategy based on viewer preferences and market trends. Around that time, Netflix might have shifted its focus to other regions or types of content that were gaining more popularity globally2.\nProduction Challenges: Political and economic instability in Turkey during that period could have impacted the production and export of TV shows and movies. This might have led to fewer Turkish productions being available for international distribution2.\nDespite these challenges, Turkish content has seen a resurgence in recent years, with Netflix investing in new Turkish originals and licensing popular Turkish dramas3.\nReference: The data comes from the following TidyTuesday Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-04-20"
